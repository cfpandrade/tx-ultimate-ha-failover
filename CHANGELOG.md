# Changelog

All notable changes to the TX Ultimate HA Failover project.

## [2.0.0] - 2024-10-30

### ðŸš€ Major Improvements

#### Ping-Based Monitoring
- **Replaced TCP connection checks with ICMP ping** for Home Assistant monitoring
- More reliable detection of HA availability
- Added packet loss percentage tracking
- Added network latency monitoring in milliseconds
- Better diagnostics in logs with detailed metrics

**Benefits:**
- Lower-level protocol (more reliable)
- Firewall-friendly (ping usually allowed)
- Can detect network congestion vs complete outages
- Lighter weight than TCP connections
- More accurate failure detection

#### Bluetooth Proxy
- **Added built-in Bluetooth Low Energy proxy**
- Extends Home Assistant's Bluetooth range by ~10-30 meters per device
- Zero configuration required - auto-discovered by HA
- Active scanning for better device detection
- Works with all HA-supported BLE devices:
  - Temperature/humidity sensors
  - Bluetooth trackers
  - Fitness bands
  - Smart locks
  - And more

**Configuration:**
```yaml
esp32_ble_tracker:
  scan_parameters:
    interval: 1100ms
    window: 1100ms
    active: true

bluetooth_proxy:
  active: true
```

### ðŸ”§ Technical Changes

#### Dependencies
- Added `ESP32Ping` library to platformio_options
- Added `esphome-component-ping` external component from GitHub

#### Sensors
- New: `ha_packet_loss` - Tracks packet loss percentage to HA
- New: `ha_latency` - Tracks ping latency to HA in milliseconds
- Both sensors are internal (not exposed to HA interface)

#### Watchdog Improvements
- Watchdog now uses ping sensor data instead of WiFiClient
- Improved logging with packet loss and latency metrics
- Threshold changed from connection failure to >80% packet loss
- More granular detection of network issues

#### Code Quality
- Replaced `WiFiClient.connect()` with ping sensor checks
- Cleaner failure detection logic
- Better error messages with diagnostic data
- Removed dependency on TCP port configuration for monitoring

### ðŸ“š Documentation

- Updated README.md with ping monitoring details
- Updated ARCHITECTURE.md with ping logic explanation
- Added Bluetooth Proxy section to ARCHITECTURE.md
- Updated PROJECT_SUMMARY.md with new features
- Added system diagram showing BLE tracker integration

### ðŸŽ¯ Configuration

No breaking changes - all existing configurations remain compatible!

New optional features work out of the box with default settings.

## Migration Guide

### From 1.0.0 to 2.0.0

**No migration needed!** Version 2.0.0 is fully backward compatible.

The new ping monitoring and Bluetooth proxy features are automatically enabled and require no configuration changes.

**What happens automatically:**
1. Ping sensor starts monitoring HA on next reboot
2. Bluetooth proxy activates and becomes discoverable in HA
3. Watchdog logic seamlessly switches to ping-based detection
4. All existing configurations continue to work

**Optional: View new sensors**

If you want to see packet loss and latency in HA, change `internal: true` to `internal: false`:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: ping
    ip_address: ${ha_ip}
    # ... other settings ...
    loss:
      name: "${friendly_name} HA Packet Loss"
      id: ha_packet_loss
      internal: false  # Changed from true
    latency:
      name: "${friendly_name} HA Latency"
      id: ha_latency
      internal: false  # Changed from true
```
